# Databases lab 2b: reading data from a database

### Set up python

Here's what you run the first time after you log in:

    exec bash
    wget http://tinyurl.com/MEETpythonY2
    source MEETpythonY2

If you have already run the code above but you've opened a new terminal window, please run:

    exec bash
    source ~/y2-venv/bin/activate

#### Exercise: Update
1. Suppose Lorenzo changes his first name to Lori. Update his name in the
   database, and use both `print_databases.py` and `session.query` to make sure
   your change worked.

2. Do the same thing if Priscila changes her first name to Anastasia.
