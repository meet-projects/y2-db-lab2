# Databases lab 2d: deleting data from a database

### Set up python

Here's what you run the first time after you log in:

    exec bash
    wget http://tinyurl.com/MEETpythonY2
    source MEETpythonY2

If you have already run the code above but you've opened a new terminal window, please run:

    exec bash
    source ~/y2-venv/bin/activate

#### Exercise: Delete
From Python, remove all the instructors and staff from the database so that only students
and TAs are left.
