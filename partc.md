### Set up python

Here's what you run to set up Python:

#### Exercise: Update
1. Suppose Lorenzo changes his first name to Lori. Update his name in the
   database, and use both `print_databases.py` and `session.query` to make sure
   your change worked. Remember, you can look at part b to find the commands to
   paste in to Python for running `session.query`.

2. Do the same thing if Priscila changes her first name to Anastasia.
